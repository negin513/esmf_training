README for ATM-OCN-LND NUOPC prototype

NOTE: 

The driver esm.F90 is only partially complete because
the LND component is not registered with the driver
and there are no connectors set up to transfer data
between LND and ATM.  See esm.F90 for more info.

Also, assume LND component (lnd.F90) is also not quite
complete.  It is using a default time step of 15 minutes
from the driver clock.  However, for stability reasons,
assume it needs to be changed to 5 minutes.  See lnd.F90
for more info.

----------------------------------

Dependencies:
  - ESMF v7.0.0 beta
  
Build:
  - Set environment variable ESMFMKFILE to point to the esmf.mk of your ESMF
    installation.
  - gmake
  
Execution:
  - Optionally set environment variable ESMF_RUNTIME_COMPLIANCECHECK to ON.
  - mpirun -np X ./esmApp (where X is the total number of PETs)
  
Output:
  - PET*.Log files containing compliance checker output if turned on.
  - The prototype outputs time stepping information to stdout.
